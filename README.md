# running a sepolia node tutorial

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and running a Sepolia testnet node on your local machine, mimicking a full node on the Ethereum mainnet. You will learn how to generate an Externally Owned Account (EOA), run the node, and set up a validator to earn rewards while contributing to Ethereum's security and decentralization.

### Prerequisites:

#### *Execution and Consensus Clients*:

- OS: 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X 10.14+, Windows 10+ 64-bit.
- Memory: 8 - 16 GB RAM.
- Storage: 2TB SSD for a full node running Geth and a consensus client while a "full" archive node that keeps all state back to genesis requires more than 12TB of space.
- Network: 8 MBit/sec broadband connection.
- Basic knowledge of the command line.
- [Go-Ethereum (Geth)](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth) installed on your machine using a package manager Or downloaded on your machine with developer tools included [Go-Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads) . 
- [Prysm as consensus client](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/getting-started)

#### *Validator*:

- All above requirements in addition to 32 ETH to stake on testnet &/or mainnet.
